Sure, here is a summary of the section "Single-lead ECG synthesis from video-PPG" from the article "Your smartphone could act as a pulse-oximeter and as a single-lead ECG":

The section describes a novel method for synthesizing a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) from video-photoplethysmography (vPPG) signals obtained using a smartphone camera. The method utilizes a deep learning approach based on a discrete cosine transform (DCT) and a feedforward neural network (FNN).

The DCT-FNN method first extracts pulse rate (PR) and pulse volume (PV) information from the vPPG signal. The PV information is then transformed into the frequency domain using the DCT. The DCT coefficients are then fed into the FNN, which learns to map the DCT coefficients to the corresponding ECG signal.

The authors evaluated the performance of the DCT-FNN method on a dataset of 20 subjects. The results showed that the method was able to synthesize ECG signals with high accuracy, comparable to those obtained using traditional ECG electrodes.

The authors conclude that the DCT-FNN method has the potential to enable continuous and non-invasive ECG monitoring using a smartphone camera. This would have a significant impact on the field of mobile health, as it would allow for easy and convenient monitoring of cardiovascular health.

Several parts of the single-lead ECG synthesis from video-PPG method can be implemented using the iOS SDK and CoreML. Here's a breakdown of the steps that can be done using these tools:

**Data Acquisition:**

- The iOS SDK provides frameworks like AVFoundation and AVCaptureDeviceInput to capture video data from the smartphone camera.

**Preprocessing:**

In summary, the iOS SDK and CoreML can be effectively utilized for various stages of the single-lead ECG synthesis from video-PPG pipeline, including data acquisition, preprocessing, PR and PV extraction, and ECG synthesis. These tools provide a powerful combination for developing mobile applications that can monitor cardiovascular health in a non-invasive and continuous manner.

**P2E-Net**
Listed steps to training the P2E-Net using CoreML, based on the instructions from the Single-lead ECG synthesis from video-PPG:

**Data Preparation**:

Collect a dataset of video-PPG and ECG signals: Gather a comprehensive dataset of synchronized video-PPG and ECG signals from a diverse group of individuals. Ensure the dataset adequately represents the variability in physiological conditions and skin tones.

Preprocess the data: Apply preprocessing techniques to both video-PPG and ECG signals to remove noise, artifacts, and unwanted variations. This may involve filtering, normalization, and segmentation.

Extract PR and PV features from vPPG: Utilize signal processing techniques to extract pulse rate (PR) and pulse volume (PV) features from the preprocessed video-PPG signals. These features will serve as the input to the P2E-Net model.

Label the ECG data: Manually label the ECG data with the corresponding RR intervals, which represent the time between consecutive R peaks. These labels will be used as the ground truth for training the P2E-Net model.

Divide the data into training, validation, and testing sets: Randomly divide the preprocessed data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set will be used to train the P2E-Net model, the validation set will be used to fine-tune the model hyperparameters, and the testing set will be used to evaluate the final model's performance.

**Model Training**:

Choose a CoreML model implementation framework: Select a suitable CoreML model implementation framework, such as Create ML or TensorFlow Lite. These frameworks provide tools for building, training, and integrating machine learning models into iOS applications.

Define the P2E-Net architecture: Design the P2E-Net architecture using the chosen framework. The P2E-Net consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a decoder network. The encoder extracts features from the PR and PV features, while the decoder generates the RR intervals based on the extracted features.

Train the P2E-Net model: Train the P2E-Net model using the training set. Optimize the model hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer, using the validation set to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Evaluate the trained model: Assess the performance of the trained P2E-Net model on the testing set. Calculate metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) to quantify the accuracy of RR interval estimation.

**Model Integration and Deployment**:

Convert the trained model to CoreML format: Convert the trained P2E-Net model into a CoreML format compatible with iOS devices. This involves packaging the model weights and architecture into a CoreML model file.

Integrate the CoreML model into the iOS app: Integrate the CoreML model into the iOS app using the CoreML framework. This allows the app to load and execute the model for real-time RR interval estimation from video-PPG data.

Deploy the iOS app to the App Store: Submit the developed iOS app to the App Store for review and distribution. This allows users to download and install the app on their iOS devices.

By following these steps, you can effectively train and integrate the P2E-Net model into an iOS app for single-lead ECG synthesis from video-PPG.

Edge computing or cloud computing? Not all the DL models proposed in this work (and previous works) could be implemented on the resource-constrained devices. For example, **ResNet50 model** and **Vitals-CLIP** model proposed in this work have higher memory requirements and higher computational complexity compared to the other models (see Table 4). This makes their deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g., Arduino, raspberry pi, low-end smartphones etc.) difficult. However, if latency is not an issue, then cloud computing could be one viable solution for the resource-constrained devices. Similarly, high-quality synthesis of a single-lead ECG in this work requires efficient preprocessing (which involves wavelet filtering, peaks detection and signal detrending), which increases the computational complexity of our approach, yet the situation remains under control when we port our method to an Android app. For the sake of records, we have been able to successfully implement the lighter version of our CNN-Net model onto a regular smartphone by means of **Tensorflow lite** framework. That is, in a real-time setting, our custom android app computes the HR and SpO2 of a subject about a minute, while it takes about three minutes to compute the RR of the subject. This demonstrates that some of our proposed DL models are quite suitable for edge AI computing on resource-constrained devices.
